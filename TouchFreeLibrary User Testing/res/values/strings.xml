    <string name="intro_text">Thank you for agreeing to test out the new TouchFreeLibrary interface.\n\nBefore we begin the tests, let\'s run a brief tutorial to show you how the interface works.</string>

    <string name="gesture_test_intro">
        It is now time to practice your skills. On the next screen, you will see a
        series of arrows. Make gestures in the direction of these arrows until you
        feel substantially comfortable. After that, you will perform an identical
        activity, only this time your results will be recorded. Feel free to take as
        long as you need to in the practice round.
    </string>
    
    <string name="click_sensor_intro">
        Some applications using TouchFreeLibrary will have users click without actually
        touching the screen. One of the input methods provided is a clap sensor. Try clapping
        to get to the next screen.
    </string>
    
    <string name="cursor_intro">
        Another feature programs using TouchFreeLibrary have access to is a cursor that emulates
        tapping using gestures and some sort of click sensor, in this case, claps. To move the
        cursor, use your directional gestures. To stop the cursor, go in the opposite direction.\n\n
        A cursor has been conviently placed on this screen. Feel free to mess around with it until
        you feel comfortable moving it around.\n\n
        When you\'re finished, clap to start the next activity.
    </string>
    
    <string name="closer">
        That\'s all!\n\n
        Thanks for testing some of the TouchFreeLibrary interfaces. You\'re efforts will not have been in vain.\n\n
        Sincerely,\n\n
